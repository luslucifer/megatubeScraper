# Megatube and Upcloud Scraper Development Environment

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luslucifer/megatubeScraper.git
cd megatubeScraper
npm install
```

## Running the Scraper

For simulating or running the Puppeteer-based scraper, use the following command:

```bash
node simulation/megaScraper.js
```

> **Note:** Puppeteer is not recommended for production use, as it can be slow and may strain your VPS resources. I am currently developing a Mega scraper that does not rely on a headless browser.

## Support

You can reach out and get support on Discord: [Join here](https://discord.gg/aAPmfsRD).

## To-Do List

- Development environment where the scraper never pauses due to DevTools detection (âœ… Completed)
- Creating an npm package (ðŸš§ In Progress)

Happy hacking! âœ¨
